          practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings and also on
          Emvite.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version
          that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify
          you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via
          email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised
          Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall supersede any prior agreements (except as specifically stated
          herein), and shall govern your entire relationship with Emvite, including but not limited to events,
          agreements, and conduct precedin g your acceptance of this Agreement.

          you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other

          <br>
          <b>4. Modifying the Service and Termination.</b>
          <br>
          Emvite is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find
          engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as
          remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not
          provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will
          notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from
          doing so.
          <br>
          You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in “Settings” in the
          Service, <b>however if you use a third party payment account, you will need to manage in app purchases through
            such account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing.</b>
          <br>
          Emvite may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this
          Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is
          terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and
          Emvite: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Users.</b>
          <br>
          Though Emvite strives to encourage a respectful user experience through features like the chat that only
          allows users to communicate if they have both Emvited each other, <b>it is not responsible for the conduct of
            any
            user on or off of the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other users, particularly
            when you meet in person. In addition, you agree to review and follow Emvite’s policies prior to using the
            Service. You agree that you will not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or
            bank
            account information), or wire or otherwise send money, to other users.</b>
          <br>
          <b>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EMVITE DOES
            NOT CONDUCT
            CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. EMVITE MAKES
            NO
            REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF USERS.</b> EMVITE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT – AND YOU
          AGREE
          THAT EMVITE MAY CONDUCT - ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER
          SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Rights Emvite Grants You.</b>
          <br>
          Emvite grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and

          <br>
          <br>
          <b>7. Rights you Grant Emvite.</b>
          <br>
          By creating an account, you grant to Emvite a worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and
          license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute information
          you authorize us to access from Facebook, as well as any information you post, upload, display or otherwise
          make available (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other users (collectively, “Content”).
          Emvite’s license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that Emvite’s license shall be exclusive with
          respect to derivative works created through use of the Service..\ In addition, so that Emvite can prevent the
          use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize Emvite to act on your behalf with respect to
          infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other users or third parties. This expressly
          includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA
          Takedown Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of the Service.
          Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding
          personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by those laws) and
          is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and
          developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may
          be viewed by other users and may be viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as
          individuals who may receive shared Content from other Emvite users).
          <br>
          You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your account, including information submitted
          from your Facebook account, is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on the Service
          and grant the license to Emvite above.
          <br>
          You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post as part of the Service. We may
          delete any Content, in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the
          reputation of the Service.
          <br>
          In consideration for Emvite allowing you to use the Service, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our
          third-party partners may place advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to Emvite
          regarding our Service, you agree that Emvite may use and share such feedback for any purpose without
          compensating you.
          <br>
          You agree that Emvite may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do
          so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary, such
          as to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content
          violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the
          rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>8. Community Rules.</b>
          <br>
          By using the Service, you agree that you will not:

          purposes
          from other users or disseminate another person’s personal information without his or her permission.
          <br>
          &bull; use another user’s account, share an account with another user, or maintain more than one account.
          <br>
          &bull; create another account if we have already terminated your account, unless you have our permission.
          <br>
          Emvite reserves the right to investigate and/ or terminate your account without a refund of any purchases if
          you have violated this Agreement, misused the Service or behaved in a way that Emvite regards as inappropriate
          or unlawful, including actions or communications that occur on or off the Service.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>9. Other Users’ Content.</b>
          <br>
          Although Emvite reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates this Agreement, such Content is
          the sole responsibility of the user who posts it, and Emvite cannot guarantee that all Content will comply
          with this Agreement. If you see Content on the Service that violates this Agreement, please report it within
          the Service or via <span style="color: blue;"><u>help@Emvite.com</u></span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>10. Purchases.</b>
          <br>
          Generally. From time to time, Emvite may offer products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) such as
          “Ghost mode”, “unlimited emojis”, “unlimited Emvites” (collectively known as “Premium Services”) or any other
          service or product that we deem to offer through Emvite direct billing or other payment platforms authorized
          by Emvite. If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the
          applicable payment provider, and your method of payment (your “Payment Method”) will be charged at the prices
          displayed to you for the service(s) you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed
          on your payments, and you authorize Emvite or the third party account, as applicable, to charge you.
          <br>
          <b>Auto-Renewal.</b> If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription, your Payment Method will
          continue to be
          billed for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again
          after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional
          equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. <b>If you do not wish your subscription to
            renew
            automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your
            third
            party account (or Account Settings on Emvite) and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if
            you
            have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Emvite application from your
            device.</b>
          Deleting your account on Emvite or deleting the Emvite application from your device does not cancel your
          subscription; Emvite will retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until you cancel your subscription
          on Emvite or the third party account, as applicable. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your
          subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed
          after your then-current term expires.
          <br>
          <b>Additional Terms that apply if you pay Emvite directly with your Payment Method.</b> If you pay Emvite
          directly,
          Emvite may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received
          payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, Emvite may
          terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.
          <br>
          You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting Emvite and going to “Profile- Settings-Payment
          Methods.” If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and
          you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your subscription, you remain responsible for any
          uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may
          result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or
          replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or
          debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by
          agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen
          Payment Method.
          ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
          EMVITE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER
          COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED PREMIUM FEATURES WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR
          INVOLUNTARY.
          <br>
          <b>Refunds.</b> Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits
          for
          partially used premium features. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested
          within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for
          refunds.
          <br>
          For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North
          Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, the terms below apply:
          <br>
          You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third
          business day following the date you subscribed. In the event that you die before the end of your subscription
          period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your
          subscription which is allocable to the period after your death. In the event that you become disabled (such
          that you are unable to use the services of Emvite) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be
          entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to
          the period after your disability by providing the company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as
          described below.
          <br>
          To request a refund:
          <br>
          You may email or deliver a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this

          SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE

          <br>
          <br>
          <b>15. Retroactive and Prospective Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver.</b>
          <br>
          Except where prohibited by applicable law:
          <br>
          1 - The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement
          (including
          any alleged breach thereof), or the Service, regardless of the date of accrual and including past, pending,
          and future claims, shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association under the
          Consumer Arbitration Rules. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to
          bring an individual claim against Emvite in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction in the county in
          which you reside, or in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Such arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions
          only, unless either you or Emvite elect to invoke the right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator. But
          whether you choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will not under any circumstances
          commence, maintain, or participate in any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or
          proceeding against Emvite.
          <br>
          2 - By accepting this Agreement, you agree to the Arbitration Agreement in this Section 15. In doing so, BOTH
          YOU
          AND EMVITE GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Emvite (except for
          matters that may be properly taken to a small claims court and are within such court’s jurisdiction). YOU ALSO
          GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING, including, without limitation,
          any past, pending or future class actions, including those existing as of the date of this Agreement, if any.
          <br>
          3 - If you assert a claim against Emvite outside of small claims court, your rights will be determined by a
          NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all issues
          regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. The same is true for Emvite. Both you and Emvite are entitled to a
          fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally grant the relief that a court can, but you
          should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
          judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court
          only for very limited reasons.
          <br>
          4 - The Jurisdiction and Venue provisions in Sections 16 and 17 are incorporated and are applicable to this
          Arbitration Agreement.
          As you decide whether to agree to this Arbitration Agreement, here are some important considerations:
          <br>
          &bull; Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil
          judge
          or a jury. Instead, the parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties under the
          Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration does not limit or affect the
          legal claims you as an individual may bring against Emvite. Agreeing to arbitration will only affect where
          those claims may be brought and how they will be resolved.
          <br>
          &bull; Arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute resolution process than the judicial
          system,
          but that is not always the case. The Arbitrator will typically determine whether Emvite or you will be
          required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration with Emvite, based on the circumstances presented.
          <br>
          &bull; IMPORTANT: IN THE EVENTUALLITY THAT ANY LAWSUITS AGAINST EMVITE ALLEGING CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE
          CLAIMS ON
          YOUR BEHALF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTIONS WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN SOME
          MONETARY OR OTHER RECOVERY TO YOU, IF YOU ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION
          AGREEMENT. THE MERE EXISTENCE OF SUCH CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH
          LAWSUITS WILL ULTIMATELY SUCCEED, OR, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL, THAT YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ANY RECOVERY.
          <br>
          &bull; You will be precluded from bringing any class or representative action against Emvite, unless you
          timely opt
          out of the retroactive application of this Arbitration Agreement, and you will also be precluded from
          participating in any recovery resulting from any class or representative action brought against Emvite, in
          each case provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and class action waiver previously
          agreed to with Emvite.
          <br>
          &bull; Under Rule R-9 of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, either party to an arbitration involving a claim
          within
          the jurisdiction of a small claims court may choose to have the case decided by the small claims court
          instead. Please review Rule R-9 for more details. Nothing in this Agreement, including the right of the
          consumer (but not Emvite) to file a dispute directly in small claims court rather than initiating arbitration,
          should be construed as being inconsistent with either party’s right to invoke Rule R-9 after an arbitration
          has been initiated.
          <br>
          WHETHER TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU
          SHOULD TAKE CARE TO CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS — INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN
          ATTORNEY — REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT
          BUSINESS OR LIFE DECISION.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>16. Governing Law.</b>
          <br>
          Except where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Puerto Rico, U.S.A., without regard
          to its conflict of laws rules, shall apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
          Service, or your relationship with Emvite. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section
          15 above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>17. Venue.</b>
          <br>
          Except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction in the county
          in which you reside or in San Juan, Puerto Rico, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to
          the Service, or to your relationship with Emvite that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration
          will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Juan, Puerto Rico, U.S.A. You and Emvite
          consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Puerto Rico and waive any claim
          that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>18. Indemnity by You.</b>
          <br>
          You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Emvite, our
          affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and
          all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorney’s fees,
          due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, your Content, or your
          breach of this Agreement.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>19. Entire Agreement; Other.</b>
          <br>
          This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy, and any terms disclosed to you if you purchase or have
          purchased additional features, products or services we offer on the Service, contains the entire agreement
          between you and Emvite regarding your relationship with Emvite and the use of the Service, with the following
          exception: anyone who opted out of the retroactive application of Section 15 is still subject to and bound by
          any prior agreements to arbitrate with Emvite as well as this agreement to arbitrate on a going forward basis.
          If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full
          force and effect. The failure of Emvite to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall
          not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your Emvite account is non-transferable and
          all of your rights to your account and its Content terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint
          venture, fiduciary or other special relationship or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and
          you may not make any representations on behalf of or bind Emvite in any manner.
